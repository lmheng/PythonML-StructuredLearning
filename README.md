# PythonML-StructuredLearning
Python ML Project for Structured Learning

This is a team project for our Python Machine Learning module.

As each member has been assigned to work on different model, I am only uploading my portion of the project where I used K-NN Classification

Project Specifications:

Select datasets from the followings
• https://data.gov.sg/
• https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php
• https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
• The source dataset must contain a minimum of 300 rows of data

Develop machine learning models (total 3 sets of models)

a) Classification techniques
Choose three of the followings and do a comparison of the
outcome:
• Logistic Regression
• K-NN Classification
• Decision Trees

b) Perform data or feature engineering to evaluate the
impact on the outcome
